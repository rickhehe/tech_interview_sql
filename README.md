# Tech Intervew SQL

## Simple Machines

I was asked to open a text editer and my screen. Then the interviewer sent me a link to the questions.

The information provided include
* schema
* sample tables
* questions

No dummy database was provide so I wasn't able to run the query and see the output during the course.

The coding part lasted for about 30 min and then it came the Q and A part. The questions asked were mostly about improving query performance.

There was a question about OLTP and OLAP.
